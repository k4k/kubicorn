# Issues

Remember to craft your issues in such a way as to help others who might be facing similar challenges. 
Give your issues meaningful titles, that offer context.
Please try to use complete sentences in your issue.
Everything is okay to submit as an issue, even questions or ideas.

Issue sizes (small, medium, large) represent amount of effort, and not complexity or skill. 

# Pull Requests 

Try to keep pull requests tidy, and be prepared for feedback.
Everyone is welcome to contribute to `kubicorn` but I do keep a high quality of code standard. 
Be ready to face this.
Feel free to open a pull request for anything, at anything. 
Everyone is welcome. 

# Testing

As the tool continues to mature we will implement a testing harness.
Once the harness is in place, tests will be required for all bug fixes and features.
No exceptions.
