# kubicorn

Create, manage, snapshot, and scale Kubernetes infrastructure in the public cloud.

**NOTE:** This is a work-in-progress, we do not consider it production ready.
Use at your own risk and if you're as excited about it as we are, maybe you want to join us on the #kubicorn channel in the Gophers Slack community.

## About

`kubicorn` is an **unofficial** project that solves the Kubernetes infrastructure problem and gives users a library to work with infrastructure.

`kubicorn` is a project that helps a user manage cloud infrastructure for Kubernetes.
With `kubicorn` a user can create new clusters, modify and scale them, and take a snapshot of their cluster at any time.

If you're new to `kubicorn`, check out this end-to-end [walkthrough](docs/walkthrough.md) or watch the [walkthrough video](https://www.useloom.com/share/a0afd5034e654b0b8d6785a5fa8ec754).

## Why I built this tool

**I built this tool for myself, and you should not use it.**

I have strong opinions about software, and how infrastructure management could be handled. I believe in pulling configuration out of the library, and using a tool like this as a framework more than an actual tool. This tool is designed to give myself easy ways to manage infrastructure in the clouds I work most in. I wanted a tool that did that, so I coded one.

If you don't like it, don't use it.

## How is Kubicorn different?

1) We use kubeadm to bootstrap our clusters
2) We strive for developer empathy, and clean and simple code.
3) We strive for operational empathy, and clean and simple user experience
4) We start with struct literals for profiles, and then marshal into an object
5) We offer the tooling as a library, more than a command line tool
6) We are atomic, and will un-do any work if there is an error
7) We run on many operating systems
8) We allow users to define their own arbitrary bootstrap logic
9) We have no guarantee that anything works, ever, use at your own risk
10) We have no dependency on DNS
11) We believe in snapshots, and that a user should be able to capture a cluster, and move it.

# Concepts

### Create

`kubicorn` let's a user create a Kubernetes cluster in a cloud of their choice.

### Apply

Define what you want, then apply it. That simple.

### Adopt

`kubicorn` can adopt any Kubernetes cluster at any time.

### Scale

`kubicorn` is powered by a state enforcement model.
A user defines the intended state of Kubernetes infrastructure, and `kubicorn` can enforce the intended state.

### Snapshot

`kubicorn` allows a user to take a snapshot of a Kubernetes cluster, and run the image in any cloud at any time.
A snapshot is compressed file that will represent intedend infrastructure **and** intended application definitions.
Take a snap, save a snap, deploy a snap.

### Enforce

`kubicorn` is built as a library and a framework. Thus allowing it to be easily vendored into operator and controller patterns to enforce indeded state of infrastructure.
