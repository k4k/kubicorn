# kubicorn

Create, manage, snapshot, and scale Kubernetes infrastructure in the public cloud.

**NOTE:** This is a work-in-progress, we do not consider it production ready.
Use at your own risk and if you're as excited about it as we are, maybe you want to join us on the #kubicorn channel in the Gophers Slack community.

## About

`kubicorn` is a project that solves the Kubernetes infrastructure problem.

`kubicorn` is a command line tool that helps a user manage cloud infrastructure for Kubernetes.
With `kubicorn` a user can create new clusters, modify and scale them, and take a snapshot of their cluster at any time.

If you're new to `kubicorn`, check out this end-to-end [walkthrough](docs/walkthrough.md).

### Create

`kubicorn` let's a user create a Kubernetes cluster in a cloud of their choice.

### Adopt

`kubicorn` can adopt any Kubernetes cluster at any time.

### Scale

`kubicorn` is powered by a state enforcement model.
A user defines the intended state of Kubernetes infrastructure, and `kubicorn` can enforce the intended state.

### Snapshot

`kubicorn` allows a user to take a snapshot of a Kubernetes cluster, and run the image in any cloud at any time.
